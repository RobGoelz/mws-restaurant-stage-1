### Running

Due to the feed reader not working using the usual HTML preview link, please git clone or download the project [from here](https://github.com/RobGoelz/mws-restaurant-stage-1). Once you have downloaded the file, navigate to the directory the file is running in. To correctly display this you will need to run a local Python server, details below are from the original Udacity instructions:

_In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software._

## Contributing

This repository is a fork of the the starter code for _all_ Udacity students, but I have modified the CSS, JS, and HTML code in order to complete the project.

I welcome constructive criticism or help to make this program better!
